Data Scientist â€“ Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository showcases a curated collection of Machine Learning algorithms, systematically organized into Supervised and Unsupervised learning categories. Each algorithm is implemented and linked to its dedicated section within this repository for in-depth exploration.

ðŸ§  Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for making predictions. It is primarily divided into two main types: Classification and Regression.

1. Classification Algorithms
These algorithms are used for predicting a categorical output variable (e.g., species in the Iris dataset).

Decision Trees
A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
Implementation: decision_tree_model.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width (features) to predict species (target).

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Powerful and versatile models capable of performing linear or non-linear classification.
Implementation: svm_model.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width (features) to predict species (target).

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
Implementation: knn_model.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width (features) to predict species (target).

Logistic Regression
A linear model widely used for binary and multi-class classification problems.
Implementation: logistic_regression_model.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width (features) to predict species (target).

Random Forest
An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of their classes.
Implementation: random_forest_model.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width (features) to predict species (target).

2. Regression Algorithms
These algorithms are used for predicting a continuous output variable (e.g., sepal_length in the Iris dataset).

Linear Regression
A fundamental algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.
Implementation: linear_regression_model.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width (features) to predict sepal_length (target).

ðŸ’¡ Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns, structures, and relationships within the data.

1. Clustering Algorithms
These algorithms are used for grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity.

K-Means Clustering
Partitions n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
Implementation: kmeans_clustering.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width. Aims to group similar iris flowers.

Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a hierarchy of clusters, either by merging (agglomerative) or splitting (divisive) clusters.
Implementation: hierarchical_clustering.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width. Reveals nested groupings.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Identifies clusters based on data point density, capable of finding arbitrarily shaped clusters and detecting outliers.
Implementation: dbscan_clustering.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width. Groups dense regions and marks sparse points as noise.

2. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
These algorithms are used for reducing the number of features (dimensions) in a dataset while retaining important information.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Transforms correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables (principal components) that capture most of the data's variance.
Implementation: pca_dimensionality_reduction.py
Suitable Iris Dataset Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width. Reduces the four features to fewer principal components for easier visualization or analysis.
