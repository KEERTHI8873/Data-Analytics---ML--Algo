Machine Learning Algorithm Used – Random Forest Classifier
1. Overview
Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification and regression tasks.
It works by creating an ensemble of decision trees—hence the term "forest"—and making predictions based on the majority vote (classification) or average (regression) of those trees.

In this project, Random Forest is used to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical measurements:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

2. Why Random Forest for the Iris Dataset?
The Iris dataset is small and balanced (150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes). Random Forest is chosen because:

High accuracy with minimal parameter tuning.

Handles small datasets well without overfitting.

Can handle non-linear relationships between features and target.

Provides feature importance scores to understand which measurements matter most.

3. How Random Forest Works
Step 1: Bootstrapping the Data
Random Forest starts by creating multiple subsets of the original dataset using bootstrapping (sampling with replacement). Each subset is used to train a separate decision tree.

Step 2: Random Feature Selection
When building each tree, the algorithm randomly selects a subset of features at each split rather than considering all features. This introduces randomness and helps avoid correlation between trees.

Step 3: Growing Decision Trees
Each decision tree learns decision rules like:

If Petal Length ≤ 2.45 cm, then species = Setosa.

Else, check Petal Width to decide between Versicolor and Virginica.

Step 4: Voting Mechanism
When a new sample is given, every decision tree predicts a class label. The majority vote is taken as the final prediction.

Example:

Tree 1 → Setosa

Tree 2 → Setosa

Tree 3 → Versicolor
Result: Setosa (majority vote)

4. Key Parameters Used in This Project
Parameter	Description	Example Value
n_estimators	Number of decision trees in the forest	100
max_depth	Maximum depth of each tree	None (grow fully)
random_state	Ensures reproducibility of results	42
criterion	Function to measure split quality	"gini" or "entropy"

5. Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate the Random Forest model using:

Accuracy Score – Percentage of correctly predicted samples.

Confusion Matrix – Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

Classification Report – Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Example:
Accuracy: 96.67%
Precision (Setosa): 1.00
Recall (Versicolor): 0.95
F1-score (Virginica): 0.96

6. Feature Importance in Iris Dataset
Random Forest provides a feature importance ranking to understand which features influence predictions the most.

Example output:

Petal Length → Most important feature.

Petal Width → Second most important.

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

This aligns with botanical knowledge—petal measurements are more effective for distinguishing species than sepal measurements.

7. Advantages of Random Forest
Works well with small datasets.
Robust to overfitting due to randomization.
Handles missing values and outliers well.
Provides explainability via feature importance.
